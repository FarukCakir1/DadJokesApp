# DAD JOKES APP

This is the first simple project I've developed using React. Class components and lifecycle methods are used. Before starting topics like hooks and coontext, I aimed to learn the basics.

## Introduction

 - This app includes a sidebar and an area where jokes are listed
 - The application has two components.JokeList and Joke
 - Initially 10 jokes are listed in the application and these are saved in localstorage
 - Every joke can be voted up and down
 - Every joke has emojis that show its quality
 - This emojis change depending on the votes for the joke
 - Again, based on the votes, the jokes are ranked from best to worst.
 - When the listed jokes are finished, 10 new jokes are brought with the button on the sidebar and the previous jokes are not removed. All of the jokes are saved in localstorage again
 - All jokes came from [This](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) API
